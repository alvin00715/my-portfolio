        <h1>Penetration Testing and Social Engineering</h1>
        <img src="images/pentest-thumb.png" alt="Pentest Cover">
        <p>This project was conducted using a white-hat approved testing site, combining technical tools and OSINT methods to uncover vulnerabilities through both penetration testing and social engineering techniques.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Maltego</strong> – Infrastructure mapping and email/network recon</li>
    <li><strong>dig</strong> – DNS record analysis for domain insights</li>
    <li><strong>Whois</strong> – Domain registration and contact info lookup</li>
    <li><strong>Recon-ng</strong> – Automated recon framework for gathering data from public sources</li>
    <li><strong>The Harvester</strong> – Email and subdomain collection via open-source search engines</li>
    <li><strong>OpenSSL</strong> – SSL certificate and encryption configuration inspection</li>
    <li><strong>OWASP ZAP</strong> – Web vulnerability scanning, form inspection</li>
    <li><strong>Nmap</strong> – Port scanning and vulnerability fingerprinting</li>
    <li><strong>Nessus</strong> – Deep vulnerability scanning and reporting</li>
    <li><strong>Sherlock</strong> – Social media username search to identify employee presence across platforms</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Maltego</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-maltego.png" alt="Maltego Screenshot">
        <p>Maltego mapped the organization's infrastructure, including email naming conventions, DNS, SMTP, remote access servers, and IP addresses. This helped identify potential vectors for spear-phishing and impersonation attacks.</p>

        <h3>Dig & Whois</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-whois.png" alt="DNS Lookup Screenshot">
        <p>Used to retrieve DNS records and registration data for subdomain mapping and email routing analysis. These insights supported network structure analysis and threat modeling.</p>

        <h3>Recon-ng</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-recon-ng.png" alt="Recon-ng Scan">
        <p>Used to automate information gathering on target domains and individuals. Integrated with APIs for passive data collection to build detailed target profiles.</p>

        <h3>The Harvester</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-harvester.png" alt="The Harvester Result">
        <p>Collected emails, subdomains, and hosts from public sources like search engines and PGP key servers, assisting in building the footprint of the target company.</p>

        <h3>OpenSSL</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-openssl.png" alt="OpenSSL Output">
        <p>Used to inspect SSL/TLS certificates for domain validation, cipher strength, and certificate expiration. Helped identify weak encryption practices.</p>        

        <h2>2. Penetration Testing</h2>
        <h3>OWASP ZAP</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-zap.png" alt="ZAP Scan Result">
        <p>Discovered the login form used POST method. SQL injection attempts showed varied responses including error codes and blocked access, suggesting backend filtering.</p>

        <h3>SQL Injection Attempts</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-sql.png" alt="SQL Injection Test Result">
        <ul>
            <li>Inputs tested: <code>' OR 1=1</code>, <code>abc' OR password='p@ssw0rd' --</code></li>
            <li>Received custom error messages and HTTP 403, confirming input handling but access denial</li>
            <li>Some inputs led to different error responses indicating backend logic differences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Nmap Port Scanning</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-nmap.png" alt="Nmap Scan Result">
        <p>Scanned for open ports and vulnerabilities using Nmap with Vulners script. Ports 80 and 443 were open and responsive, while most others were filtered.</p>

        <h3>Nessus Scanning</h3>
        <img src="images/pentest-nessus.png" alt="Nessus Report">
        <p>Nessus scanning exposed HTTP method settings and web server details. While informative, these were not classified as high-risk findings.</p>

        <h2>3. Social Engineering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed the company’s organizational chart to identify potential phishing targets</li>
            <li>Researched employee data from social media and public sources for leaked info</li>
            <li>Planned pretext scenarios such as IT support impersonation based on findings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This assessment revealed several areas where the target organization's digital and human-layer defenses could be improved. Tools like ZAP and Nmap helped uncover server-side vulnerabilities, while SQL injection testing highlighted gaps in form sanitization. OSINT tools like Maltego, Sherlock, and The Harvester enabled a clearer picture of publicly exposed data and employee digital footprints.</p>

        <p>Despite encryption being in place, reliance on legacy systems and limited training exposed weaknesses that could be exploited via social engineering. The simulated attacks emphasized the value of continual testing and awareness-building as a defense strategy.</p>

        <p>To mitigate risks, we recommend: enhanced security training, strict credential management, improved email/server hardening, and third-party risk assessments. Ultimately, penetration testing plays a critical role in uncovering vulnerabilities and empowering organizations to make informed improvements in their cybersecurity posture.</p>
